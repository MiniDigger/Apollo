# Apollo

#### What is apollo? ####

** Apollo is an open source Entity AI framework for the Sponge Server distribution. Meant too target serious AI frameworks, that are highly flexible, and highly capable. As such the framework is very specialized in some cases. I tried to make it less specialized, but the framework would not be the same without the specilization. **

** To See more about the framework you can check out the thread on the SpongeForums (or the wiki once i get around to it). **
